            Personal Portfolio
This is the start of my personal portfolio website. The goal is to begin a space for me to showcase my abilities, skills, and projects as I move foreward with my IT career.

The site currently has buttons that animate when hovered on and will lead to the other tabs on my site.

This website will allow me to eventually market myself to potential emplyers.A visitor to the site will be able to view all applicable hiring materials and portfolio work quickly and easily.
